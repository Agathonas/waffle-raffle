Waffle Raffle is an innovative open-source platform designed for fundraising, charitable events, and giveaways, enabling organizations to set up campaigns and engage communities in meaningful ways. Leveraging the Starknet chain, our platform offers a secure, transparent, and decentralized way to organize raffles, raising funds for various causes or simply spreading joy through giveaways. From luxury items to unique experiences, Waffle Raffle makes it easy for anyone to participate and support their favorite causes.

## How it Works üé≤

1. Users can enter raffles by purchasing entries using the $WAFFLE token.
2. Each raffle has a specific item up for grabs, an entry fee, and a set duration.
3. A portion of the total amount collected in each raffle (0-30%) is allocated as a fee to support charitable causes and fund development.
4. Once the raffle duration ends, a winner is randomly selected from the pool of participants.
5. The lucky winner receives the prize, and the raffle concludes.

## Features ‚ú®

- Secure and transparent raffle system built on the Starknet chain

## Smart Contract üìú

The Waffle Raffle smart contract is written in Cairo and provides the core functionality for creating, entering, and concluding raffles. The contract ensures secure and transparent operations, with only authorized admins able to create and manage raffles.

The contract leverages the power of Starknet's scalability and security, providing a seamless and trustworthy raffle experience for all participants.
