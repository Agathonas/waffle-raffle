## How it Works 🎲

1. Users can enter raffles by purchasing entries using the $WAFFLE token.
2. Each raffle has a specific item up for grabs, an entry fee, and a set duration.
3. A portion of the total amount collected in each raffle (0-30%) is allocated as a fee to support charitable causes and fund development.
4. Once the raffle duration ends, a winner is randomly selected from the pool of participants.
5. The lucky winner receives the prize, and the raffle concludes.

The contract leverages the power of STARKNET's scalability and security, providing a seamless and trustworthy raffle experience for all participants.
