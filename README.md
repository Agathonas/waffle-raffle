## How it Works 🎲

1. Users can enter raffles by purchasing entries using the $WAFFLE token.
2. Each raffle has a specific item up for grabs, an entry fee, and a set duration.
3. Once the raffle duration ends, a winner or multiple winners is randomly selected from the pool of participants.
4. The lucky winners receives the prize, and the raffle concludes.

## Features ✨
